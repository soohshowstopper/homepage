            <h3>5. COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
            <p>When you use this Site or a Kiosk, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use this Site, a Kiosk, or our applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information.
            </p>
            <p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to this Site or our Kiosks by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.
            </p>
            <p>For example, when you visit this Site or a Kiosk, SOOH Media and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Units. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with this Site or a Kiosk.
            </p>
            <p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. "Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases session cookies once you exit your browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences (e.g., geographical preferences for vouchers and coupons).
            </p>
            <p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on online pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
            </p>
            <p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access this Site or a Kiosk, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses of the devices you use to interact with this Site or a Kiosk. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to this Site and the website you visit after you leave this Site, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.
            </p>
            <p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about users of this Site or a Kiosk to optimize this Site and our Kiosks and to understand its traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. In that case, this Privacy Policy governs how we use that information.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive location information, we will collect that automatically. If we associate location information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Policy governs how we would use that information too.
            </p>
            <p>SOOH Media has relationships with third party advertising companies to place advertisements on our behalf onto other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for this Site, our Kiosks, and our advertisements. We do not share Personal Information with third party advertising companies; however, these third parties may automatically collect information about your visit to this Site and other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use to visit this Site. They do this by using cookies, clear gifs and other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of this Site or a Kiosk and the other websites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by these third parties, and SOOH Media is not responsible for cookies or clear gifs in third party ads. We encourage you to review the privacy policies or statements of these third party advertising companies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technologies. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by third party advertisers, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org.

            </p>
            <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and to maintain a record of your transactions for financial reporting purposes.

            </p>

            <h3>10. NOTICE TO RESIDENTS OF COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</h3>

           	<h3>11. PRIVACY PRACTICES OF THIRD PARTIES</h3>
           	<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information by SOOH Media through your interaction with this Site or a Kiosk. Other websites that may be accessible through links from this Site or a Kiosk may have their own privacy statements and personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices.

           	<h3>12. COMMUNITIES</h3>
           	<p>This Site or a Kiosk may contain Communities and other areas where you may be able to publicly post information, communicate with others such as discussion boards or blogs, review products and merchants, and submit media content.

            <p>SOOH Media offers Facebook users the opportunity to interact with friends and to share on Facebook using Facebook Connect. If you are logged into both SOOH Media and Facebook, when you use Facebook connection functions, we will link your Facebook account with your SOOH Media account if the email addresses match.
